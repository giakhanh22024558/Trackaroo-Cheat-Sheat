## How to find what you need

1. **Looking for a feature spec?** → PRODUCT → Modules → pick the module. Each module page links to its source spec (in `research/spec-docs/`).
2. **Looking for "how do we…?"** → ABOUT (process) or RULES (business rules) or TECH (architecture).
3. **Looking for "why does it work this way?"** → TECH → ADR (architectural decisions) or RULES (business constraints).
4. **Stuck?** → ABOUT → Team & contacts → ask the right person.
